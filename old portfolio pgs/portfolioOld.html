                            <p>The State of Florida Medicaid Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program is eliminating the use of paper records and enticing hospitals and providers to move to electronic records. They requested an accurate and fast way to calculate how much money providers and hospitals in Florida would receive.</p>
                            <p>I was one of three analysts employed by the Agency for Healthcare Administration. As an analyst, I was responsible for completing the calculation of Medicaid electronic health care incentive payments for eligible hospitals and to ensure all calculations were correct and completed on time.</p>
                            <p>There were two constraints of this project. Analysts were given a short window of 3 months for completion and I was learning to read and understand hospital cost reports. This was a skill I gained very quickly in order to help my team.</p>
                            <p>At the Agency for Healthcare Administration, I was given paper copies of hospital cost reports and built an Excel based system to generate audit reports and prevent cost overruns.My knowledge of Microsoft Excel and formulas was a great help to accomplish this project.</p>
                            <p>At AHCA, the use of my teamwork skills was necessary to work effectively with members of the team no matter their skill sets, personalities, or level of motivation.</p>

                                <p>Lee’s Place is a nonprofit grief and loss counseling center providing professional mental health counseling and training services for all grief or loss issues in the Tallahassee area.
                                <p>Lee's is in need of database for their donations. They have an existing database for their clients which needed to be normalized and have referential integrity. As a volunteer with an information technology and finance background, I took on both of these challenges and created a new database for their donations, while perfecting their existing patient database.</p>
                                <p>The largest challenge for completing both databases was to ensure they included all the attributes the organization required. After the initial creation of the donor database, I sat down many times with management to determine if all attributes were present. In addition, an intern without an IT background created the client database. All of the information was stored in one table, and needed to be put into different tables to ensure normalization.</p>
                                <p>For both databases, I used Microsoft Access.</p>
                                <p>At Lee’s Place, communication skills were required to articulate ideas in writing. I facilitated the project by coordinating and soliciting well-represented ideas and feedback from a group to reach the best solution. This project required my skills of data collection, analysis and visualization.</p>

                                <p>Women in IT Sharing Experiences in a student organization at Florida State University. As the President of the organization from 2011-2012, I was responsible for the creation and ongoing design of the website. </p>
                                <p>The biggest challenge of this project was time. This is a project I complete on my own during the evenings and weekends. To overcome this challenge, I set a schedule for myself to track progress and ensure the website is updated frequently to stay current.</p>
                                <p>The skills I have learned working with Wordpress & Thesis have given me confidence using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Photoshop, and PHP. </p>
                                <p>This project requires I create a website which motivates students and mentors to want to join the organization. I apply my leadership skills to create and communicate a vision and ideas that inspire others to follow with commitment and dedication.</p>

                            <p>Julie Paparelli is a professional interpreter for the deaf based in Washington D.C. She was in need of a professional website to promote her business. </p>
                            <p>Ms. Paparelli did not have an online presence and as her webmaster, it was my responsibility to create a professional site, which markets her skills as a freelance interpreter for hire.</p>
                            <p>The biggest challenge of the website was content. Ms. Paparelli did not have many professional photos and was unsure what to write about herself. After creating the website, I brainstormed with her for ideas for content. </p>
                            <p>In designing a website for Julie, I chose to use Wordpress. This time, I chose not to use Thesis, but continued to further my using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Photoshop, and PHP skills.</p>
                            <p>In working with Julie, I used my organizational skills during the creation of her website. There were numerous webpages and photos to keep organized. I also needed time management, as I completed this project during any extra time I could find in my week. Lastly, my people skills were needed in order for this project to be a success.
                                Ms. Paparelli is a family member, and sometimes it is hardest to work with those you love. You do not want to hurt their feelings or make them feel as if you are not using their ideas. For the website to be useful, I needed to be understanding, compassionate, and at times, firm.</p>
