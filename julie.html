                        <p>Julie Paparelli is a professional interpreter for the deaf based in Washington D.C. She was in need of a professional website to promote her business. </p>
                        <p>Ms. Paparelli did not have an online presence and as her webmaster, it was my responsibility to create a professional site, which markets her skills as a freelance interpreter for hire.</p>
                        <p>The biggest challenge of the website was content. Ms. Paparelli did not have many professional photos and was unsure what to write about herself. After creating the website, I brainstormed with her for ideas for content. </p>
                        <p>In designing a website for Julie, I chose to use Wordpress. This time, I chose not to use Thesis, but continued to further my using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Photoshop, and PHP skills.</p>
                        <p>In working with Julie, I used my organizational skills during the creation of her website. There were numerous webpages and photos to keep organized. I also needed time management, as I completed this project during any extra time I could find in my week. Lastly, my people skills were needed in order for this project to be a success.</p>
                        <p>Ms. Paparelli is a family member, and sometimes it is hardest to work with those you love. You do not want to hurt their feelings or make them feel as if you are not using their ideas. For the website to be useful, I needed to be understanding, compassionate, and at times, firm.</p>
