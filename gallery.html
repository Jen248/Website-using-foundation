                    <div class="panel">

                        <br />

                        <div id="purpletext">Designing For Users</div>
                        <p>Our team has been given a project in which a museum is looking for a way for users to save artifacts they have found on the website using the search feature. As a team we have developed a side panel which incorporates into the website named “the Gallery”.</p>
                        <p>We chose to use a real website of an actual museum, please note the photoshopped images on the right are ours, but the background an actual images and information belong to the Museum Of Science and Industry Chicago</p>
                        <p>When a user enters the site and decides to use the “search” feature, they have the ability to save the exhibits they wish to view at a later date. Using the new feature named “the Gallery”, with drag-and-drop capabilities users can save items as they search or browse the museum’s website.</p>
                        <p>Items can be added to the Gallery via drag-and-drop into to the Gallery box, where they are automatically stored. Once more than 3 items are dragged into the Gallery, the first 3 items appear as thumbnails. If a user decides to view items in the Gallery as a larger image, the user clicks the thumbnail to be taken to the original webpage where the item is located.</p>

                        <br />
                        <div id="greytext">Functionality and Navigation:</div>
                        <p>Once items are selected and placed into the Gallery box, they will be categorized based off of their default value. For instance, if the user adds one item (for instance a painting), and then decides to add a second item (a sculpture), the Gallery will create two sections labeled respectively. After items are populated in the user’s Gallery, a list of options will be available to manipulate the thumbnails or the names of each section. If a user chooses to edit or delete an item they have added to the gallery, they can simply right click on the image or the entire collection and manage each item from the drop down list. Additionally, you can also use the right-click dropdown list feature to manually rename, move, and combine collections.</p>
                        <p>Any items not in the top three of each are stored in each section but are not seen until you click the “Explore” button. Once the user taps the “Explore” button a flyout bar will appear. The flyout bar will have a scroll effect in which the user can view the different thumbnails. To view each of items in the flyout the user can click any of the thumbnails to be taken to the original webpage that contains the description of the item.</p>

                        <br/>
                        <div id="browntext">Graphic and Visual Display</div>
                        <p>The Museum website will display an opaque box that includes a fixed scroll when navigating through pages of items. The fixed-scroll will keep the gallery box present in entirety on the site page. The interface will also boast a rich, visual display to appeal to a wide range of users. The website is designed to complement the art stored at the Museum, and we want to ensure fluidity between the site and Gallery box. Transparent boxes with clean lines give the Gallery a simple, aesthetic feel streamlined with the web site.</p>
                        <p>Users may login with Facebook to save their Gallery choices; however, this is not required. Browsers save items added to the Gallery by use of cookies until the user clears the cache. Users can also e-mail their Gallery to friends by use of the Gallery’s URL. They may also choose to share the Gallery by sending via text message to a friend’s cell phone containing the Gallery’s url by entering the friend’s mobile number.</p>

                        <br />
                        <div class="middle">
                            <img src="images/deleteRename.png" alt="delete and rename boxes"/>
                        </div>

                        <div id="greytext">Obstacles:</div>
                        <p>Many challenges were faced in trying to maintain the integrity of a true all-in-one design. As a result, a more intuitive design has been developed to help eliminate the user learning curve. The design team has additionally revised how the gallery should be accessed; a required Facebook, Gmail, or Twitter logon will help increase likeliness of registration, and will allow the museum the track user experiences to gain a better understanding of which demographics come to the museum website.</p>
                        <p>Another obstacle hindering our initial design was the heavy use of the right-click mouse for editing options.  We didn’t take into account that most people won’t right-click intuitively, unless they wanted to copy or paste. The design team decided to implement help buttons throughout the user’s initial experiences with the Galleria.  The option to keep the help buttons will remain after the user has visited the site numerous times is still yet to be determined; the user may grow tired of recurring help objects constantly being present.</p>



                        <div class="middle">
                            <img src="images/attention.png" alt="attention" />
                        </div>

                        <br/>
                        <div id="greytext">Design Features:</div>
                        <p>Many layout changes made the gallery less burdensome to register for and will greatly increase the probability of registration. A simple, yet mysterious little box with a protruding, red ‘?’ button at the base of the gallery immediately demands your attention when entering the site. Once the user clicks on the giant red ‘?’ button, they will be taken to a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ )page that will provide them with additional information on how the gallery operates and its intended use.</p>
                        <p>The use of an Open/Shrink tab will greatly reduce the amount of space the Gallery box will take if the user does not wish to register.</p>
                        <p>Once the user logs on by clicking one of the Facebook/Twitter/Gmail log-on buttons, the Galleria box will expand into full-view mode.</p>
                        <p>The user may also shrink and re-expand the gallery box by clicking on the tab and dragging the mouse upward or downward.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, further design changes are being discussed to implement a close button, but how and where the close button will function is still under development for final iteration.</p>

                        <br />
                        <div id="greytext">Social Media Dashboard</div>
                        <p>By requiring the user to login with their various social media profiles, we will be able to pull that information from their profile and display it in a dashboard view on the Gallery. A small profile created using the pre-existing information from the users’ social media web site.  This will not only add convenience for the user, but their profile will have a true identity attached to each gallery.</p>

                        <br/>
                        <div id="greytext">User Data Collection</div>
                        <p>The gallery dashboard function will also gather important information for the museum to analyze. Auto collection of data will also deter unfilled information categories and increase data integrity. The Gallery will track likes and interests on the museum, as well as on their social media website, to analyze the specifics on the users who collect. Our project team believe that we the museum will be to have a better understanding of why users come to the website and what do they expect to see from the museum as well.</p>
